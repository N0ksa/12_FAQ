                How much blood is inside my body? 
            </h3>
            <p>
                The human body contains approximately 6 quarts (5.6 liters) of blood. Blood acts as your body’s transportation system—in one day, your blood travels nearly 12,000 miles (19,312 kilometers).

                What is the human body’s biggest organ? 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Your skin is your body’s largest organ and acts as a barrier to the outside world. It covers your entire body and has a surface area of around 21.5 square feet (2 square meters). Its thickness ranges from 0.02 inch (0.5 millimeter) on your eyelids to 0.16 inch (4 millimeters) or more in “tougher” areas, such as on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.

                How can you measure a heartbeat?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Doctors measure heart rate—the number of contractions of the heart (or heartbeats) in one minute—by taking a person’s pulse or listening to the heart with a stethoscope. Your heart rate can be taken at any spot on the body at which an artery is close to the surface and a pulse can be felt, such as the wrist or the neck.

                How much air does a person breathe in their lifetime? 
            </h3>
            <p>
                During a person’s life, they will breathe about 75 million gallons (284 million liters) of air. Every minute, the human body needs 2 gallons (7.5 liters) of air when lying down, 4 gallons (15 liters) when sitting, 6 gallons (23 liters) when walking, and 12 gallons (45 liters) or more when running.

                What causes a bruise?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A bruise is a common skin injury that causes discoloration of the skin, usually yellowish, brownish, or purplish spots. Blood from damaged blood vessels deep beneath the skin collects near the skin’s surface, resulting in a “black and blue” mark. You can get a bruise by bumping into something or someone, or by something or someone bumping into you.
